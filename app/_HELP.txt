Usage:
  ssh-env [ssh] [<user>@]<ssh-server>
  ssh-env agent (status|stop|config)
  ssh-env datadir (init|clone|global-install|global-uninstall)
  ssh-env key (create|install|check|load)
  ssh-env (help|--help|-h)
  ssh-env (version|--version|-v)

Commands:
  ssh [<user>@]<ssh-server>  SSH into the specified server. The command is optional. Use it when
                             the server name conflicts with any of the other commands.

  agent status               Check whether the ssh-agent is running and has a private key loaded
  agent stop                 Stops the ssh-agent (removing any loaded private key from memory)
  agent config               Creates configuration file for ssh-agent (per computer and not shared)

  datadir init               Creates a fresh ssh data dir (containing the ssh key pair and ssh config)
  datadir clone              Clones an existing ssh data dir with git
  datadir status             Prints various information about the datadir
  datadir global-install     Makes the data dir available to all ssh processes for the current user
                             (by overwriting ~/.ssh/config)
  datadir global-uninstall   ssh-env no longer manages ~/.ssh/config

  key create                 Creates a new private key (bcrypt encrypted)
  key install [<user>@]<ssh-server>[:port]
                             Installs your public key on the specified server (requires password
                             authentication to be enabled on the server)
  key check                  Checks your private key for problems (no password, weak encryption)
  key load                   Loads your private key into the ssh-agent (so that it can be used
                             by applications other than ssh-env)

  help, --help, -h           Displays this help page
  version, --version, -v     Prints the ssh-env and OpenSSH client version
